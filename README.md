   - **Purpose**: Collect logs from various sources (files, stdout, etc.).
   - **Components**:
     - File Watcher
     - Log Parser
     - Log Shipper

2. **Log Storage**:
   - **Purpose**: Store logs in a scalable and queryable format.
   - **Components**:
     - Database Schema
     - Database Connection
     - Log Inserter

3. **Query Interface**:
   - **Purpose**: Provide an interface to query and visualize logs.
   - **Components**:
     - HTTP Server
     - Query Endpoints
     - Query Engine

### Todo List

#### 1. Set Up Your Rust Project

- [ ] Create a new Rust project using `cargo new log_aggregator`.
- [ ] Add necessary dependencies to `Cargo.toml` (e.g., `notify`, `serde`, `diesel`, `actix-web`).

#### 2. Log Collection

- [ ] Implement a file watcher to monitor log files for changes.
- [ ] Create a log parser to convert raw log data into a structured format.
- [ ] Develop a log shipper to send parsed logs to the storage component.

#### 3. Log Storage

- [ ] Design a database schema for storing logs.
- [ ] Implement database connection logic.
- [ ] Create a log inserter to save logs into the database.

#### 4. Query Interface

- [ ] Set up an HTTP server using `actix-web`.
- [ ] Define query endpoints to retrieve logs based on criteria (e.g., timestamp, level).
- [ ] Implement a query engine to execute queries against the log storage.

#### 5. Integration and Testing

- [ ] Integrate all components and ensure they work together seamlessly.
- [ ] Write unit tests for each component.
- [ ] Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle high log volumes.

#### 6. Documentation and Optimization

- [ ] Document the code and architecture.
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Implement security measures for query endpoints and log storage.

### Detailed Design

#### Log Collector

- **File Watcher**:
  - Monitors log files for changes.
  - Uses the `notify` crate to watch for file events.

- **Log Parser**:
  - Parses raw log data into a structured format (e.g., JSON).
  - Uses the `serde` crate for serialization.

- **Log Shipper**:
  - Sends parsed logs to the storage component.
  - Handles retries and error logging.

#### Log Storage

- **Database Schema**:
  - Defines tables and columns for storing logs.
  - Example: `logs` table with columns `id`, `timestamp`, `level`, `message`.

- **Database Connection**:
  - Establishes a connection to the database.
  - Uses the `diesel` crate for ORM.

- **Log Inserter**:
  - Inserts parsed logs into the database.
  - Handles batch inserts for better performance.

#### Query Interface

- **HTTP Server**:
  - Sets up an HTTP server using `actix-web`.
  - Defines routes for querying logs.

- **Query Endpoints**:
  - Endpoints to retrieve logs based on criteria.
  - Example: `/query?level=INFO&start=2023-10-01T00:00:00Z&end=2023-10-01T23:59:59Z`.

- **Query Engine**:
  - Executes queries against the log storage.
  - Returns results in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

### Final Thoughts

Building a log aggregator from scratch is a complex task, but breaking it down into manageable components and following a structured plan will help you succeed. Good luck with your project!
